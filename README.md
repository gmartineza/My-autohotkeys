# My-autohotkeys
Autohotkey script to help reduce the ocasions you need to take your fingers off the home-row, inspired on the layers functionality of 60% keyboards.

This is a fork from **WASD Alt Arrows Script**, by **B0sh**. You can check out his work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z29KF4aauww&t) and [here](https://gitlab.com/B0sh/ahk/blob/master/wasd-alt-arrows/wasd-alt-arrows.ahk).

___

To make the script run at boot, you need to make a file shortcut in the startup folder:

1. Press `Win+R`.
2. Type `shell:startup` in the Run window. 
3. While holding `alt`, drag and drop the .ahk script to the folder.

___

You can suspend this script by right-clicking on the green H on your taskbar, and then clicking "My autohotkeys" (there's a tick indicating the status of the script).
