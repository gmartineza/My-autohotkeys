# My-autohotkeys
Autohotkey script to help reduce the ocasions you need to take your fingers off the home-row, inspired on the layers functionality of 60% keyboards.
This is a fork from "WASD alt arrow keys", by B0sh. You can check out his work here:

To make the script run at boot, you need to make a file shortcut in the startup folder. Access said folder via Win+R, then type shell:startup.
